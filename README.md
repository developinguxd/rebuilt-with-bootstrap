Rebuilt with Bootstrap
======================

This is an Open Source project of [Developing UXD] (http://developinguxd.com).

How to participate
------------------

[Fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and add a folder with the name of the website. In that folder you add all sources (including bootstrap.css) to have a running prototype of that website. Push that folder to Github. Then create a Pull Request.

If you don't know how to use git and Github, maybe better download the free [Github App](https://mac.github.com/).
